    CDSI Test 2013-0524: This test case describes when the second dose of the
    MMR vaccine is administered at 4 years of age, that the dose is considered
    valid. The series is complete.

    Note: Original test uses Priorix (different manufacturer) for Dose 2 to
    verify that different MMR products are interchangeable.
  cdcGuidance: "Routine MMR dose 1 at 12-15 months, dose 2 at 4-6 years"
