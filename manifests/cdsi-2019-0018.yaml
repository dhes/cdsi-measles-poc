  notes: |
    CDSI Test 2019-0018: This test case describes when an adult patient
    received a dose of the MMR vaccine, that no additional doses are needed.
    Series is complete.

    Per CDSI conditional skip logic: Dose 2 can be skipped for patients
    >= 19 years of age who have received one valid dose.
  cdcGuidance: |
    Adults born in 1957 or later should receive at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine
    unless they have evidence of immunity. Some adults may need 2 doses
    (students in post-secondary educational institutions, healthcare personnel,
    international travelers).

    The conditional skip reflects that most adults without special risk factors
    are considered adequately protected with 1 dose.
