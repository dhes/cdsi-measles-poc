  notes: |
    CDSI Test 2015-0024: This test case describes when a patient was born
    before January 1, 1957, that the patient is considered to be Immune.

    New test case for version 2.0 which expanded scope into Adult recommendations.

    Important: This immunity presumption applies UNLESS the patient is a
    healthcare worker (see test cdsi-2015-0024-healthcare for that scenario).
  cdcGuidance: |
    Persons born before 1957 are generally considered immune to measles and
    mumps. However, healthcare personnel born before 1957 without laboratory
    evidence of immunity or disease should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine.
